# Kubernetes Troubleshooting Patterns

A comprehensive guide to diagnosing and resolving common Kubernetes issues in production environments.

## Introduction

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, but with its power comes complexity. In this article, we'll explore systematic approaches to troubleshooting Kubernetes issues in production environments.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Pod Scheduling Problems

When pods won't schedule, check:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

Look for events that indicate why the scheduler couldn't place the pod.

### Network Connectivity Issues

Network policies, service mesh configurations, and CNI issues can all cause connectivity problems.

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- curl -v <service-name>
```

### Resource Constraints

Resource pressure is a common cause of instability:

```bash
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods
```

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

For more complex issues, consider:

1. Using ephemeral debug containers
2. Analyzing logs with tools like Loki or Elasticsearch
3. Implementing distributed tracing with Jaeger or Zipkin

## Conclusion

By following these patterns, you can systematically approach Kubernetes troubleshooting, reducing MTTR and improving system reliability.
